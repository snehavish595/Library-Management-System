* **Form Validation:** Includes client-side validation to ensure book details are correctly entered.
* **Dynamic Table Display:** New books are instantly added to the collection table without page reload.
* **Search Functionality:** (Note: The current search input is present, but functionality would need to be implemented for full search capability).
